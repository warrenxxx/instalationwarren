STOP RIGHT HERE. Security reports should never start out in the open. Please follow up directly with the team if you have a contact. If not you can always start with the information at https://chocolatey.org/security to see instructions on how to provide the disclosure - the Chocolatey Team can route it to the proper folks if it is not for Chocolatey or Boxstarter. Thank you!
